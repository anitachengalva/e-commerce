# E-COMMERCE BACK END

## Description

The [MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) and [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize) npm packages are utilized to connect an Express.js API to a MySQL database containing models for `Category`, `Product`, `Tag`, and `ProductTag`. Then the [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) package is utilized to store sensitive data and use environmental variables.  

API GET, POST, PULL, and DELETE routes in Insomnia are used to display, create, update, and delete data in the database.
